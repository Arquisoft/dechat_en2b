== Solution Strategy

Here the main principles of our project are listed below:

* 1. Implement a Model-View-Controller architectural pattern. The MVC design pattern decouples these major components allowing for efficient code reuse and parallel development. 
* 2. Develop the application mainly with JavaScript programming languaje and using Solid as Backend data container decupling each user personal data from others.
* 3. Use of design patterns but limiting the complexity of the implementation.
* 4. The application is going to be Peer to Peer in order to keep personal information confidential.
