== Design Decisions
Here we state the more important design decisions that have been taken in this project.

=== JavaScript as programming language
As stated in section 4, we will use JavaScript programming language to develop our application. The majority of the code and information that can be found about Solid uses JavaScript. That is the main reason why we decided to work with this programming language, as it is easier to adapt Solid to it.

=== Use Angular framework to build the application
In the documentation of Solid there exists some help regarding the implementation of Solid applications using Angular or React. From these two, we decided to use Angular, as we found it a more complete framework.
