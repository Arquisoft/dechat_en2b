== Runtime View

We have a turtle file for each of the chats, every file contains the messages, the hour and the person who created them.
That file will be stored in your POD and you and the participants of the group (in case of a group chat) will be owners of this file so they will have access to the data inside of it. This is managed in such a way that if we can not find the file in niether of the PODs then the system will create a new one.

In order to send a message we add the turtle's statements of the corresponding message to the file using the method updateManager.

For showing the messages, we have a method that load the messages of the file (text and hour) and then it shows all of them. This method is called when the messages's file is changed.

We also need to update the messages file and we do this by using webSockets that notify when a message changes and when this notification appears in the system, the function getLastMessage() is called and the messages will be updated.
