== Building Block View

Sole is basically implemented using the Solid Platform which has provided the foundations of the project and we also rely in Angular for the structure of the project. 
Mainly what Sole does is providing the users with a decentralized chat where they could send messages to each other and store them in their own PODs.

To build this application we used (as previously explained) the Solid Platform that uses PODs, external libraries and tests. Everything managed by the user. 

Inside this POD we can login our own POD, there are models, services, there’s also the chat which is the one the user will access later. In the Tests part we are using mainly cucumber to make user stories tests.
-The services used are authentication, file manager and rdf. 
-The main advantage of the chat is that it is decentralized and this makes possible for you to keep your data safe, no one else could see what your messages are or who are you sending those messages to.

=== Level 2

In this level we have The Solid Platform that is the foundation of the project, it provides the PODs and each user has a unique one. The chat is accessed by the user using this PODs  to communicate between them. We also have external libraries that are written in the package.json they are the dependencies and we can also update them with command “npm install”. Testing our applications is also in this level.

In the next level we can see zoom in Chat and Tests


=== Level 3

Level 3 is integrated by tests and main structure of the chat. 
In the tests, we basically only used Cucumber to test our application.
The chat is composed by models, services and also the components in order for the application to work in the most efficient way. Relying on the Solid Platform to make the chat decentralized.



=== Level 4

Finally on the level 4 we have the services which are the Authentication, RDF, Changes and File Manager. We also make zoom in the Components that we have, nav, register, login, dashboard, card, chat and about.
With all this, we can make our application run so that the chat will work and we will be able to send messages and files.
