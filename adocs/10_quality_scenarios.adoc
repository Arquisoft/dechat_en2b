=== Quality Scenarios
For architects, two kinds of scenarios are important:

Usage scenarios describe the system’s runtime reaction to a certain stimulus. This also includes scenarios that describe the system’s efficiency or performance. 
Change scenarios describe a modification of the system or of its immediate environment. 

|===
|*ref*|*quality attribute*|*quality scenario*| priority
|1|performance |a user must receive a message in less than 30 seconds |high
|2|scalability|If the number of users increased, the system must be available and the perfomance mustn’t be affected|medium
|2|scalability|the application must support up to 10 users concurrently|medium
|3|availability|a user can search up to 100 last messages |medium
|4|compatibility|the application must function with the solid platform|high
|3|avaliability|The system must be available/accessible at 90%|high
