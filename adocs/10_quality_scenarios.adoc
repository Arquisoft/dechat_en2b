=== Quality Scenarios
For architects, two kinds of scenarios are important:

Usage scenarios describe the system’s runtime reaction to a certain stimulus. This also includes scenarios that describe the system’s efficiency or performance. 
Change scenarios describe a modification of the system or of its immediate environment.
